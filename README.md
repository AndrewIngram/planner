# Planner

Lightweight, interactive planning tool that visualizes a series of tasks using an `HTMLCanvasElement`. Try it yourself at [planner-bvaughn.vercel.app](https://planner-bvaughn.vercel.app/).

I built this project for fun. It is not published anywhere at this time and I am not taking feature requests.

If you would like to say thanks for sharing the code though, feel free to buy me a cup of coffee ☕️😃 at [patreon.com/bvaughn](https://www.patreon.com/bvaughn).
